# Contributing to soft-canonicalize

Thanks for your interest in contributing! ü¶Ä

## Quick Start

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Clone** your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/soft-canonicalize-rs.git`
3. **Test** locally:
   - **Linux/macOS/WSL**: `bash ci-local.sh`
   - **Windows PowerShell**: `.\ci-local.ps1`
   - Both scripts run all CI checks including security audit
4. **Submit** a pull request

All PRs automatically run CI on Windows, Linux, and macOS with security auditing.

## How to Contribute

- **üêõ Bug reports**: [Open an issue](https://github.com/DK26/soft-canonicalize-rs/issues) with reproduction steps
- **üí° Features**: Discuss in an issue before implementing
- **üìù Docs**: Fix typos, add examples, improve clarity
- **üîß Code**: Bug fixes and improvements welcome

## Development

**Project Philosophy:**

- **std compatibility** - Match `std::fs::canonicalize` behavior for existing paths
- **Zero dependencies** - Keep it lightweight
- **Cross-platform** - Windows, Linux, macOS
- **Security focused** - Proper symlink and `..` handling with automated security auditing
- **Pure algorithm** - No filesystem modification

## AI Prompt

Copy-paste this when working with AI on this project:

```text
Rules: Always run `bash ci-local.sh` or `.\ci-local.ps1` before committing. This project must maintain 100% behavioral compatibility with std::fs::canonicalize for existing paths while extending to non-existing paths. Never remove existing APIs, tests, or break std compatibility. All std library compatibility tests must continue to pass. Preserve security features like symlink cycle detection and security auditing. Avoid redundant explanations in documentation.
```

## What We Want ‚úÖ

- Bug fixes and performance improvements
- Better error handling and documentation
- Cross-platform compatibility fixes
- Additional security tests and examples
- std library compatibility improvements

## What We Don't Want ‚ùå

- Breaking changes to std compatibility (discuss first)
- New dependencies (unless strongly justified)
- Behavior changes that break existing tests
- Features that compromise security

## Testing

**Simple**: Just run the CI script locally:

```bash
# Linux/macOS/WSL
bash ci-local.sh

# Windows PowerShell  
.\ci-local.ps1
```

This runs all checks (format, clippy, tests, docs, security audit, MSRV) and ensures std compatibility. If it passes, your code is ready.

**Test Coverage**: The project has 111 tests total:

- 78 unit tests (in `src/tests/`)
- 6 complex attack tests (blackbox security)  
- 9 security tests (comprehensive security coverage)
- 11 compatibility tests (std library compatibility)
- 4 documentation tests

**Project Structure**: 
- `src/` - Main library code and unit tests
- `examples/` - User-facing examples (essential examples only)
- `examples/archive/` - Historical examples from optimization work
- `benches/` - Performance benchmarks vs Python baseline
- `benches/python/` - Historical Python investigation scripts
- `tests/` - Integration and blackbox security tests

**Benchmarks**: Performance benchmarks are in `benches/` and can be run with `cargo bench`.

**Performance Testing**: To verify performance claims:
```bash
# Measure Python baseline on your machine
cd benches/python/
python python_fair_comparison.py

# Run Rust benchmarks
cd ..
cargo bench performance_comparison

# Compare results - expect Rust 1.1x-1.3x faster
```

See [`benches/README.md`](benches/README.md) for comprehensive performance testing guide.

**Examples**: See `examples/` directory for usage examples and demonstrations.
