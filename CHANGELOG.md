- **Performance**: Enhanced boundary detection algorithm for better performance on paths with existing prefixes
- **Cross-Platform Robustness**: Enhanced CI-safe testing patterns with panic-safe cleanup and working directory handling
- **Documentation**: Enhanced "How It Works" section to clearly explain use of `std::fs::canonicalize` internally

## [0.1.0] - 2025-07-19

### Added
- **std Library Compatibility Tests**: Added comprehensive test suite (`tests/std_compat.rs`) importing and adapting original std library canonicalize tests to ensure 100% behavioral compatibility for existing paths
- **API Enhancement**: Updated `soft_canonicalize` to accept `impl AsRef<Path>` instead of generic `<P: AsRef<Path>>` for cleaner, more modern API following Rust 2018+ best practices
- **Contributing Guidelines**: Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` with project philosophy, AI prompt for contributors, testing guidelines, and development workflow
- **Documentation Examples**: Added comprehensive examples showing usage with different path types (`&str`, `PathBuf`, `&Path`, etc.)

### Changed
- **API Modernization**: Function signature changed from `soft_canonicalize<P: AsRef<Path>>(path: P)` to `soft_canonicalize(path: impl AsRef<Path>)` for consistency with modern Rust patterns
- **Test Infrastructure**: Standardized all tests to use `tempfile` crate instead of custom temporary directory implementation for better reliability and consistency
- **Version Bump**: First stable release (0.1.0) indicating API stability and production readiness

### Improved
- **Test Coverage**: Added 8 new tests specifically for API compatibility with different path parameter types
- **Test Reliability**: Replaced custom `create_temp_dir()` and `cleanup_temp_dir()` functions with industry-standard `tempfile::tempdir()` for automatic cleanup and thread safety
- **Code Quality**: Removed ~40 lines of custom temporary directory logic in favor of standard practices
- **Documentation**: Enhanced function documentation with more comprehensive examples showing all supported input types

### Technical Details
- Maintains 100% backward compatibility for function behavior
- All 28 tests pass (14 unit tests + 11 std compatibility tests + 3 doctests)
- Zero breaking changes for existing users
- Enhanced API ergonomics without performance impact
- Standardized development and testing practices

## [0.0.3] - 2025-07-19

### Documentation
- **Streamlined README**: Reduced verbosity and condensed examples for better readability
- **Added Security Examples**: Added security validation examples with proper jail directory handling
- **Enhanced Comparison Table**: Added "Prevents symlink jail breaks" row highlighting security advantages
- **Added Ecosystem Context**: Added footnote showing `jailed-path` dependency relationship
- **Added Usage Guidance**: Added note clarifying when to use `std::fs::canonicalize` vs `soft_canonicalize`

## [0.0.2] - 2025-07-18

### Changed
- **Improved Algorithm**: Redesigned canonicalization algorithm inspired by Python's `pathlib.Path.resolve(strict=False)`
- **Better Performance**: Switched from "find existing prefix" approach to incremental symlink resolution

- **Enhanced Efficiency**: Single-pass processing instead of multiple walks up the directory tree

### Improved
- **Windows Compatibility**: Better handling of Windows path edge cases and root component preservation
- **Root Traversal**: Fixed excessive `..` component handling to properly maintain absolute paths on Windows
