A pure Rust library for path canonicalization that works with non-existing paths.

Unlike `std::fs::canonicalize()`, this library can resolve and normalize paths even when some or all of the path components don't exist on the filesystem. This is particularly useful for security validation, path preprocessing, and working with paths before creating files.

Inspired by Python's `pathlib.Path.resolve()` behavior, which can resolve paths that don't fully exist on the filesystem.

## Features

- **üöÄ Works with non-existing paths**: Canonicalizes paths even when they don't exist
- **üåç Cross-platform**: Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **‚ö° Zero dependencies**: No external dependencies beyond std
- **üîí Security focused**: Proper handling of `..` components and symlinks
- **üßÆ Pure algorithm**: No filesystem modification during canonicalization
- **üìè Zero-cost abstractions**: Minimal performance overhead

## Use Cases

Common scenarios where `soft_canonicalize` excels:
- **Web servers**: Path validation before file creation
- **Build tools**: Resolving non-existing output paths  
- **Security applications**: Safe path handling with symlink resolution

## Quick Start

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
soft-canonicalize = "0.0.3"
```

## Example

```rust
use soft_canonicalize::soft_canonicalize;
use std::path::Path;

// Works with existing and non-existing paths
let path = soft_canonicalize("some/path/../other/file.txt")?;

// Security validation (jail must exist)
fn is_safe_path(user_path: &str, jail: &Path) -> std::io::Result<bool> {
    let canonical_user = soft_canonicalize(user_path)?;
    let canonical_jail = std::fs::canonicalize(jail)?; // Jail must exist
    Ok(canonical_user.starts_with(canonical_jail))
}

// Note: Use std::fs::canonicalize when paths must exist,
// soft_canonicalize when they may not exist yet
```

## Algorithm

Combines Python's `Path.resolve()` approach with robust symlink resolution:

1. **Lexical Resolution**: Process `..` and `.` components without filesystem access
2. **Incremental Symlink Resolution**: Resolve symlinks as path components are encountered
3. **Optimized Access**: Only perform filesystem operations when components actually exist

## Security Considerations

This library is designed with security in mind:

- **Directory Traversal Prevention**: `..` components are resolved logically before any filesystem access
- **Symlink Resolution**: Existing symlinks are properly resolved using standard canonicalization  
- **No Side Effects**: No temporary files or directories are created during the canonicalization process
- **Path Injection Protection**: Proper handling of various path formats and edge cases

**Critical Security Advantage**: Unlike `path_absolutize`, this library resolves symlinks, preventing jail break attacks where malicious symlinks point outside the intended directory boundaries.

## Performance

- **Time**: O(n) where n is the number of path components
- **Space**: O(n) for component storage
- **Filesystem Access**: Optimized - only checks existing components

## Cross-Platform Support

Works correctly on Windows (drive letters, UNC paths), Unix-like systems (symlinks), and handles path separators properly across all platforms.

*`jailed-path` uses `soft_canonicalize` as a dependency for path resolution.
