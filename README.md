**Path canonicalization that works with non-existing paths.**

**Inspired by Python 3.6+ `pathlib.Path.resolve(strict=False)`** - this library brings the same functionality to Rust with enhanced performance and comprehensive testing.

## Why Use This?

**üöÄ Works with non-existing paths** - Plan file locations before creating them  
**‚ö° Fast** - Mixed workload median performance (5-run protocol): Windows ~1.8x (10,217 paths/s), Linux ~3.8x (352,751 paths/s) faster than Python's pathlib  
**‚úÖ Compatible** - 100% behavioral match with `std::fs::canonicalize` for existing paths  
**üîí Robust** - 301 comprehensive tests including symlink cycle protection, malicious stream validation, and edge case handling  
**üõ°Ô∏è Robust path handling** - Proper `..` and symlink resolution with cycle detection  
**üåç Cross-platform** - Windows, macOS, Linux with comprehensive UNC/symlink handling  
**üîß Zero dependencies** - Only uses std library

## Quick Start

### Cargo.toml
```toml
[dependencies]
soft-canonicalize = "0.3"
```

### Code Example

```rust
use soft_canonicalize::soft_canonicalize;
use std::path::PathBuf;

let non_existing_path = r"C:\Users\user\documents\..\non\existing\config.json";

// Using Rust's own std canonicalize function:
let result = std::fs::canonicalize(non_existing_path);
assert!(result.is_err());

// Using our crate's function:
let result = soft_canonicalize(non_existing_path);
assert!(result.is_ok());

// Shows the UNC path conversion and path normalization
assert_eq!(
    result.unwrap().to_string_lossy(),
    r"\\?\C:\Users\user\non\existing\config.json"
);
```

### Anchored Canonicalization

For **correct symlink resolution within virtual/constrained directory spaces**, use `anchored_canonicalize`. This function ensures symlinks resolve properly relative to an anchor directory, making it ideal for virtual filesystems, containerized environments, and chroot-like scenarios:

```rust
use soft_canonicalize::anchored_canonicalize;
use std::fs;

// Set up an anchor/root directory (no need to pre-canonicalize)
let anchor = std::env::temp_dir().join("workspace_root");
fs::create_dir_all(&anchor)?;

// Canonicalize paths relative to the anchor (anchor is soft-canonicalized internally)
let resolved_path = anchored_canonicalize(&anchor, "../../../etc/passwd")?;
// Result: /tmp/workspace_root/etc/passwd (lexical .. clamped to anchor)

// Handles symlinks with proper canonicalization within virtual space
let user_input = "uploads/../../sensitive/file.txt";
let resolved = anchored_canonicalize(&anchor, user_input)?;
// Canonicalizes paths relative to anchor - symlinks are followed to their targets
```

Key features of `anchored_canonicalize`:
- **Virtual space symlink resolution**: Ensures correct symlink behavior within bounded directory trees
- **Anchor-relative canonicalization**: Resolves paths relative to a specific anchor directory  
- **Symlink resolution**: Follows symlinks to their actual targets with proper virtual space semantics
- **Component-by-component**: Processes path components in proper order
- **Absolute results**: Always returns absolute canonical paths

### Test Coverage

**301 comprehensive tests** including:

- **11 std::fs::canonicalize compatibility tests** ensuring 100% behavioral compatibility
- **80+ robustness tests** covering consistent canonicalization behavior and edge cases  
- **42 Python pathlib test suite adaptations** for cross-language validation
- **45+ Windows UNC path tests** including unicode preservation, long paths, and mixed separators
- **50+ platform-specific tests** for Windows, macOS, and Linux edge cases
- **22+ performance and stress tests** validating behavior under various conditions
- **5 documentation tests** demonstrating API usage

### üîç Tested Against Path Handling Edge Cases

Our comprehensive test suite validates consistent canonicalization behavior across various challenging scenarios:

- **Race Condition Robustness**: Consistent canonicalization behavior even when filesystem changes during processing
- **Symlink Cycle Protection**: Detects and rejects circular symlink references to prevent infinite loops
- **Malicious Stream Detection**: Validates Windows NTFS Alternate Data Stream syntax to reject malformed or suspicious patterns
- **Path Equivalence Handling**: Consistent behavior with various path representations and edge cases
- **Short Name Handling**: Proper canonicalization behavior with Windows 8.3 short names
- **Long Path Support**: Correct handling of Windows extended-length paths and NTFS features
- **Unicode Normalization**: Consistent handling of Unicode characters, zero-width characters, and normalization forms
- **Path Resolution**: Comprehensive `..` resolution with cycle detection and boundary enforcement
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Comprehensive testing across Windows, macOS, and Linux filesystem behaviors

## What is Path Canonicalization?

Path canonicalization converts paths to their canonical (standard) form, enabling accurate comparison and ensuring two different path representations that point to the same location are recognized as equivalent. 

Unlike `std::fs::canonicalize()`, this library resolves and normalizes paths even when components don't exist on the filesystem. This enables accurate path comparison, resolution of future file locations, and preprocessing paths before file creation.

This is essential for:

- **Path Comparison**: Determining if two paths refer to the same file or directory
- **Deduplication**: Avoiding duplicate operations on the same file accessed via different paths  
- **Build Systems**: Resolving output paths and dependencies accurately
- **Future Path Planning**: Computing paths for files that will be created later
- **Path Validation**: Providing consistent, normalized paths for validation and boundary checking in applications

The "soft" aspect means we can canonicalize paths even when the target doesn't exist yet - extending traditional canonicalization to work with planned or future file locations.

## Known Limitations

### Windows Short Filename Equivalence

On Windows, the filesystem may generate short filenames (8.3 format) for long directory names. For **non-existing paths**, this library cannot determine if a short filename form (e.g., `PROGRA~1`) and its corresponding long form (e.g., `Program Files`) refer to the same future location:

```rust
use soft_canonicalize::soft_canonicalize;

// These non-existing paths are treated as different (correctly)
let short_form = soft_canonicalize("C:/PROGRA~1/MyApp/config.json")?;
let long_form = soft_canonicalize("C:/Program Files/MyApp/config.json")?;

// They will NOT be equal because we cannot determine equivalence
// without filesystem existence
assert_ne!(short_form, long_form);
```

**This is a fundamental limitation** shared by Python's `pathlib.Path.resolve(strict=False)` and other path canonicalization libraries across languages. Short filename mapping only exists when files/directories are actually created by the filesystem.

**For existing paths**, this library correctly resolves short and long forms to the same canonical result, maintaining 100% compatibility with `std::fs::canonicalize`.
