**Path canonicalization that works with non-existing paths.**

**Inspired by Python 3.6+ `pathlib.Path.resolve(strict=False)`** - this library brings the same functionality to Rust with enhanced performance and comprehensive testing.

## Why Use This?

**üöÄ Works with non-existing paths** - Plan file locations before creating them  
**‚ö° Fast** - Windows: ~1.5‚Äì2.1x faster; Linux: ~2.5‚Äì4.7x faster than Python's pathlib (mixed workloads)  
**‚úÖ Compatible** - 100% behavioral match with `std::fs::canonicalize` for existing paths  
**üîí Secure** - 158 comprehensive tests including security scenarios and path traversal prevention  
**üõ°Ô∏è Robust path handling** - Proper `..` and symlink resolution with cycle detection  
**üåç Cross-platform** - Windows, macOS, Linux with comprehensive UNC/symlink handling  
**üîß Zero dependencies** - Only uses std library

## Quick Start

### Cargo.toml
```toml
[dependencies]
soft-canonicalize = "0.2.3"
```

### Code Example

```rust
use soft_canonicalize::soft_canonicalize;
use std::path::PathBuf;

let non_existing_path = r"C:\Users\user\documents\..\non\existing\config.json";

// Using Rust's own std canonicalize function:
let result = std::fs::canonicalize(non_existing_path);
assert!(result.is_err());

// Using our crate's function:
let result = soft_canonicalize(non_existing_path);
assert!(result.is_ok());

// Shows the UNC path conversion and path normalization
assert_eq!(
    result.unwrap().to_string_lossy(),
    r"\\?\C:\Users\user\non\existing\config.json"
);
```

## Features

- **Directory Traversal Prevention**: `..` components resolved before filesystem access
- **Symlink Resolution**: Existing symlinks properly resolved with cycle detection  
- **Cross-platform Path Normalization**: Handles Windows drive letters, UNC paths, device namespaces, and Unix absolute paths
- **Extended-Length Path Support**: Automatic conversion to `\\?\` prefixes on Windows for >260 character paths
- **Unicode Preservation**: Maintains exact Unicode representation without normalization for security
 
### Test Coverage

**152 comprehensive tests** including:

- **11 std::fs::canonicalize compatibility tests** ensuring 100% behavioral compatibility
- **44 security penetration tests** covering CVE-2022-21658 and path traversal attacks  
- **25 Windows UNC path tests** including unicode preservation, long paths, and mixed separators
- **42 Python pathlib test suite adaptations** for cross-language validation
- **21 platform-specific tests** for Windows, macOS, and Linux edge cases
- **9 performance and stress tests** validating behavior under various conditions

### üîç Tested Against Known Vulnerabilities

Our comprehensive security test suite specifically validates protection against real-world vulnerabilities found in other path handling libraries:

- **CVE-2022-21658 Race Conditions**: Tests against Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) attacks where symlinks are replaced between canonicalization and file access
- **UNC Path Traversal Prevention**: Comprehensive testing of Windows UNC paths to prevent escape from share roots using `..` traversal
- **Unicode Normalization Bypasses**: Protection against attacks using Unicode normalization to disguise malicious paths, including homoglyph and zero-width character preservation
- **Double-Encoding Attacks**: Validates that percent-encoded sequences aren't automatically decoded (preventing bypass attempts)
- **Case Sensitivity Bypasses**: Tests on case-insensitive filesystems to prevent case-based security bypasses
- **Symlink Jail Escapes**: Comprehensive testing of symlinked directory attacks and nested symlink chains
- **NTFS Alternate Data Streams**: Windows-specific tests for ADS attack vectors that can hide malicious content
- **Device Namespace Security**: Tests for `\\.\` and `\\?\GLOBALROOT\` path handling to prevent device namespace exploitation
- **Filesystem Boundary Testing**: Edge cases around filename length limits and component count boundaries
- **Explicit Null Byte Detection**: Consistent error handling across platforms (unlike OS-dependent behavior)

These tests ensure that `soft_canonicalize` doesn't inherit the security vulnerabilities that have affected other path canonicalization libraries, giving you confidence in production security-critical applications.


## What is Path Canonicalization?

Path canonicalization converts paths to their canonical (standard) form, enabling accurate comparison and ensuring two different path representations that point to the same location are recognized as equivalent. 

Unlike `std::fs::canonicalize()`, this library resolves and normalizes paths even when components don't exist on the filesystem. This enables accurate path comparison, resolution of future file locations, and preprocessing paths before file creation.

This is essential for:

- **Path Comparison**: Determining if two paths refer to the same file or directory
- **Deduplication**: Avoiding duplicate operations on the same file accessed via different paths  
- **Build Systems**: Resolving output paths and dependencies accurately
- **Future Path Planning**: Computing paths for files that will be created later
- **Security Applications**: Preventing path traversal attacks and ensuring paths stay within intended boundaries

The "soft" aspect means we can canonicalize paths even when the target doesn't exist yet - extending traditional canonicalization to work with planned or future file locations.

## Known Limitations

### Windows Short Filename Equivalence

On Windows, the filesystem may generate short filenames (8.3 format) for long directory names. For **non-existing paths**, this library cannot determine if a short filename form (e.g., `PROGRA~1`) and its corresponding long form (e.g., `Program Files`) refer to the same future location:

```rust
use soft_canonicalize::soft_canonicalize;

// These non-existing paths are treated as different (correctly)
let short_form = soft_canonicalize("C:/PROGRA~1/MyApp/config.json")?;
let long_form = soft_canonicalize("C:/Program Files/MyApp/config.json")?;

// They will NOT be equal because we cannot determine equivalence
// without filesystem existence
assert_ne!(short_form, long_form);
```

**This is a fundamental limitation** shared by Python's `pathlib.Path.resolve(strict=False)` and other path canonicalization libraries across languages. Short filename mapping only exists when files/directories are actually created by the filesystem.

**For existing paths**, this library correctly resolves short and long forms to the same canonical result, maintaining 100% compatibility with `std::fs::canonicalize`.
